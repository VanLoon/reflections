When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local if I
  planned on using more than one computer, or if I planned on collaborating with other
  people. I would also want to use a remote repository as a backup, and possibly as a way
  to get free suggestions on changes I could make.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You might want to always pull changes manually in case you want to keep control over
  what changes happen in your local repository.
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
  Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally lets us check the
  changes we make against the remote version, as it last stood. It also helps in resolving
  merge conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
  To collaborate without using Git, I would use either Google Drive or Dropbox
  to share files with my collaborators. It would be easier, because there is no
  tricky command-line entry and no branch time-travel headaches. It would be
  harder to keep everyone abreast of all changes, and to keep people consistently
  publishing their latest versions and maintaining good version control.
